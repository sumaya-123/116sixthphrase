101. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All
classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and
"Female" for Female class.


code:



class Person(object):
    def __init__(self):
	self.gender = "unknown"

    def getGender(self):
	print(self.gender)

class Male(Person):
    def __init__(self):
	self.gender = "Male"

class Female(Person):
    def __init__(self):
	self.gender = "Female"

sharon = Female()
doug = Male()
sharon.getGender()
doug.getGender()
