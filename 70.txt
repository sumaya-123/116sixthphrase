70. The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
 f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by
console.
Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:
7
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to
be a console input.


code:

def f(n):
    if n < 2:
        fibo[n] = n
        return fibo[n]
    fibo[n] = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
    return fibo[n]

n = int(input())
fibo = [0]*(n+1)  
f(n)              
fibo = [str(i) for i in fibo]   
ans = ",".join(fibo)    
print(ans)
